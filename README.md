# WarpScript™ Redis Extension

This extension adds functions which enables WarpScript™ code to interact with a [Redis](https://redis.io/) instance.

It adds two simple functions for storing (`RDSTORE`) and retrieving (`RDLOAD`) data.

The ability to interact with a Redis instance opens huge amount of possibilities for your WarpScript™ code, among which for example:

* caching `FETCH` or computation results
* accessing reference data
* managing multi-tier storage strategies
